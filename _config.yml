user_description: I have started programming with my best friend in primary school. Back in 1991, we were coding music and some simple games in BASIC for Commodore 64. After the college, I have started working as a journalist, with the strong interest in Web Development. Crafting websites since 2003. I remember the first shock when CSS was introduced. Nowadays, I am specialized in web programming with JavaScript technologies (Angular, Node.js, React...).
